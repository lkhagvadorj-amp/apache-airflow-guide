# What is Apache Airflow?
To understand Apache Airflow, it's essential to understand what data pipelines are. Data pipelines are a series of data processing tasks that must execute between the source and the target system to automate data movement and transformation.  For example, if we want to build a small traffic dashboard that tells us what sections of the highway suffer traffic congestion. We will perform the following tasks:

 - Fetch real-time or historic data from a traffic API.

 - Clean or wrangle the data to suit the business requirements.

 - Analyze the data.

 - Push the data to the traffic dashboard.

Apache Airflow is a batch-oriented tool for building data pipelines. It is used to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor data pipelines commonly referred to as workflow orchestration. Airflow is an open-source platform used to manage the different tasks involved in processing data in a data pipeline.

# How Does Apache Airflow Work?
A data pipeline in airflow is written using a Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) in the Python Programming Language. By drawing data pipelines as graphs, airflow explicitly defines dependencies between tasks. In DAGs, tasks are displayed as nodes, whereas dependencies between tasks are illustrated using direct edges between different task nodes. If we apply the graph representation to our traffic dashboard, we can see that the directed graph provides a more intuitive representation of our overall data pipeline.

The edges direction depicts the direction of the dependencies, where an edge points from one task to another. Indicate the task that needs to be completed before the next one is executed.

# How is Data Pipeline Flexibility Defined in Apache Airflow?
In Apache airflow, a DAG is defined using Python code. The Python file describes the structure of the correlated DAG. Consequently, each DAG file typically outlines the different types of tasks for a given DAG, plus the dependencies of the various tasks. Apache Airflow then parses these to establish the DAG structure. In addition, DAGs Airflow files contain additional metadata that tells airflow when and how to execute the files.

The advantage of defining Airflow DAGs using Python code is that the programmatic approach provides users with much flexibility when building pipelines. For instance, users can utilize Python code for dynamic pipeline generation based on certain conditions. The flexibility offers great workflow customization, allowing users to fit Airflow to their needs.

Also, when you create a DAG using Python, tasks can execute any operations that can be written in the programing language. This has, over the time led to the development of many extensions by the Airflow Community. That enables users to execute tasks across vast systems, including external databases, cloud services, and big data technologies.

# How are Pipelines Scheduled and Executed in Apache Airflow?
After a data pipeline's structure has been defined as DAGs, Apache Airflow allows a user to specify a scheduled interval for every DAG. The schedule determines exactly when Airflow runs a pipeline. Therefore, users can tell the Airflow to execute every week, day, or hour. Or define even more complex schedule intervals to deliver desired workflow output.

To further visualize how Airflow runs DAGs, we must look at the overall process involved in developing and running the DAGs.

# Components of Apache Airflow DAGs

At a high level, Apache Airflow is split into three main components, which include:

 - The Airflow Scheduler: This is responsible for parsing DAGs, checking their schedule, monitoring their intervals, and scheduling the DAGs' tasks for processing by Airflow Workers if the schedule has passed.

 - The Airflow Workers: These are responsible for picking up tasks and executing them.

 - The Airflow Webserver: This is used to visualize pipelines running by the parsed DAGs. The web server also provides the main Airflow UI (User Interface) for users to monitor the progress of their DAGs and results.


## Tasks Versus Operators in Apache Airflow
In Apache Airflow, operators are used for performing a single piece of work. Some operators perform specific work, whereas others perform generic work. For example, the BashOperator and PythonOperator are generally used to run bash and Python scripts, respectively. On the other hand, the EmailOperator and SimpleHTTPOperator are used for sending emails and calling HTTP endpoints, respectively.

While from a user's perspective, tasks and operators may be used to refer to the same thing, which is not the case in Airflow. Tasks in airflow are used to manage the execution of operators, and they can be thought of as small wrappers around operators that ensure the latter executes correctly.


# Apache Airflow Use Cases - When to Use Apache Airflow
Airflow is an excellent choice if you want a big data tool with rich features to implement batch-oriented data pipelines. Its ability to manage workflows using Python code enables users to create complex data pipelines. Also, its Python foundation makes it easy to integrate with many different systems, cloud services, databases, and so on.

Because of its rich scheduling capabilities, airflow makes it seamless for users to run pipelines regularly. Furthermore, its backfilling features make it easy for users to re-process historical data and recompute any derived datasets after making changes to the code, enabling dynamic pipeline generation. Additionally, its rich web UI makes it easy to monitor workflows and debug any failures.

# How Can Apache Airflow Help Data Engineers?
Apache Airflow is a tool that can boost productivity in the day-to-day operations of a data engineer. Just to mention a few use cases, the tool can help data engineers monitor workflows using notifications and alerts, perform quality and integrity checks, transfer data, orchestrate machine learning models, and much more.
